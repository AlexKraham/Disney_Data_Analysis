                Founded in the early 1920s, The Walt Disney Company has released hundreds of movies in a wide range of genres and although directed towards a younger audience, their movies still captivate persons of all different ages. <br><br>
                We will go through the data analyze trends in Disney movies and how movies have changed over the decades. 
                <br><br>
                <b>On the right, you will see a general overview of all the movies and its total gross income received in dollars.</b> <br><br>

                <span class="helper-text">You can hover over any bubble to reveal more information in the form of a tooltip at any time.</span> <br><br>

                To your right, you will see each movie clustered by genre of which there are 12 categories. In the data set, there are
                some missing values for the genre, these are encoded which the teal color as shown in the legend. The size of the bubble
                represents the proportion in terms of total gross income received from the movie. In this visualization, we can deduce at 
                first glance that Disney has created many comedy and action movies. The action movies seem to generally garner an above-average
                total gross revenue. <br><br>

                Conversely, there seems to have been a lot of comedies and dramas released, but as shown the size of the bubbles are smaller. <br><br>
                Some questions that we might have right now, though, is how this gross income relates in terms of inflation. Also, how about the amount
                of time it takes for a certian movie to be produced? Intuitively, a drama or comedy movie might require much less resource to produce
                than an epic action movie. Unfortunately, this data set is limited and we may only be able to answer some of these questions.

                <p>
                    In this bar chart, we can see that adventure clearly is the most popular genres that Disney releases. This category envelops many very high budget movies such as Star Wars VII
                    Finding Nemo, The Jungle Book, Toy Story, and other classics. <br><br>
                    However, we must take into account that most movies in the adventure category have a very high budget and require a lot of time to produce. For example, Star Wars VII grossed $940 million
                    (adjusted for inflation) and the film's conception was back around 2012. On January 2013, they named directors. The script took about a year, and filming began in 2014. The film was released at the end of 2015. 
                    This was nearly a 3-4 year process. <br><br>
                    If we contrast this with a comedy movie like Freaky Friday ($150 million, adjusted for inflation), the movie was wrapped up within about 1-2 years. <br><br>
                    The question begs, which movie genre gives the higher rate of return and the fastest?

                <h2>Does Gender Influence Chosen Majors?</h2>
                Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the students which are male or female? 
                In this chart, blue represents majors with > 60% male, and red represents > 60% female, and the grey bubbles represent the more gender 
                balanced courses.
                <br><br>(Hover over the labels if you've forgotten the category)<br><br>

                What is striking about this graphic is that almost every category grouping of majors are either decidedly more female-weighted or male-weighted,
                with the exception of perhaps the business and physical sciences majors.  
                </p>
                 
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                When we plot the % of students in a major being female against the median salary of students in the major, a fairly clear trend emerges. 
                It appears that majors with a higher proportion of male students also produce students with higher median wages. <br><br> In fact, a linear model
                would predict that for every added percentage of female students in a given major, the median annual salary drops by $306 USD.

            <section class="step">
                So we've seen the most 'profitable' majors, as well as the ones with the most uneven gender distributions. But what are students 
                actually enrolling in the most frequently? What can enrolment numbers tell us about actual interest in each major? This chart has the bubbles 
                sized based on the number of students enrolled in each major, and coloured by category. 
                <svg id = 'legend3' width = '400px' height = '350px'></svg>
                Psychology is the clear leader in this regard, with over 390,000 students enrolled. Business related topics such as general business, business management,
                accounting and finance are all also heavily enrolled.
